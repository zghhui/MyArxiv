However, the quadratic time complexity of attention\noperation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to\nthe extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching\nkey-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free\napproach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse\nproperty of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor\nsearch (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most\nrelevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf\nANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for\naccurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.\nRetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention,\nand addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt\nto queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time\ncomplexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of\nlong-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the\nmodel accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for\nserving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating\none token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).\n","authors":["Di Liu","Meng Chen","Baotong Lu","Huiqiang Jiang","Zhenhua Han","Qianxi Zhang","Qi Chen","Chengruidong Zhang","Bailu Ding","Kai Zhang","Chen Chen","Fan Yang","Yuqing Yang","Lili Qiu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10516v1.pdf","comment":"16 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1","updated":"2024-09-16T17:59:50Z","published":"2024-09-16T17:59:50Z","title":"An Efficient Self-Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog\n  Systems","summary":"  Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users\nin complex, evolving conversations.

However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning\ncapabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this\nwork, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as\nsolving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to\nsearch over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then\napply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the\napplication of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in\na cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,\nmultiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We\nobserve that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn\nto solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)\nwhen trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that\ntraining Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and\nwithout such training, they fail to learn Sudoku.

Most existing works tackle the single-scene scenario with\nonly one video event occurring in a single background.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework, namely VideoStudio, for consistent-content and multi-scene video\ngeneration. Technically, VideoStudio leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to\nconvert the input prompt into comprehensive multi-scene script that benefits\nfrom the logical knowledge learnt by LLM. The script for each scene includes a\nprompt describing the event, the foreground/background entities, as well as\ncamera movement. VideoStudio identifies the common entities throughout the\nscript and asks LLM to detail each entity. The resultant entity description is\nthen fed into a text-to-image model to generate a reference image for each\nentity. Finally, VideoStudio outputs a multi-scene video by generating each\nscene video via a diffusion process that takes the reference images, the\ndescriptive prompt of the event and camera movement into account. The diffusion\nmodel incorporates the reference images as the condition and alignment to\nstrengthen the content consistency of multi-scene videos.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel and training-free approach for the effective visual token\npruning of MLLMs, termed FitPrune, which can quickly produce a complete pruning\nrecipe for MLLMs according to a pre-defined budget. Specifically, FitPrune\nconsiders token pruning as a statistical problem of MLLM and its objective is\nto find out an optimal pruning scheme that can minimize the divergence of the\nattention distributions before and after pruning. In practice, FitPrune can be\nquickly accomplished based on the attention statistics from a small batch of\ninference data, avoiding the expensive trials of MLLMs. According to the\npruning recipe, an MLLM can directly remove the redundant visual tokens of\ndifferent examples during inference.

In that vein, I will\nillustrate how this can be done by applying two such theories to the case of\nlanguage models: Gareth Evans' (1982) account of naming practices and Ruth\nMillikan's (1984, 2004, 2005) teleosemantics. In doing so, I will argue that it\nis a mistake to think that the failure of LLMs to meet plausible conditions for\nmental intentionality thereby renders their outputs meaningless, and that a\ndistinguishing feature of linguistic intentionality - dependency on a\npre-existing linguistic system - allows for the plausible result LLM outputs\nare meaningful.\n","authors":["Jumbly Grindrod"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09576v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10077v1","updated":"2024-09-16T08:28:05Z","published":"2024-09-16T08:28:05Z","title":"LLM-DER:A Named Entity Recognition Method Based on Large Language Models\n  for Chinese Coal Chemical Domain","summary":"  Domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER), whose goal is to recognize\ndomain-specific entities and their categories, provides an important support\nfor constructing domain knowledge graphs.

As a result, the scarcity of labeled data in a\nspecific domain will limit its application.Therefore, many researches started\nto introduce few-shot methods and achieved some results. However, the entity\nstructures in specific domains are often complex, and the current few-shot\nmethods are difficult to adapt to NER tasks with complex features.Taking the\nChinese coal chemical industry domain as an example,there exists a complex\nstructure of multiple entities sharing a single entity, as well as multiple\nrelationships for the same pair of entities, which affects the NER task under\nthe sample less condition.In this paper, we propose a Large Language Models\n(LLMs)-based entity recognition framework LLM-DER for the domain-specific\nentity recognition problem in Chinese, which enriches the entity information by\ngenerating a list of relationships containing entity types through LLMs, and\ndesigning a plausibility and consistency evaluation method to remove\nmisrecognized entities, which can effectively solve the complex structural\nentity recognition problem in a specific domain.The experimental results of\nthis paper on the Resume dataset and the self-constructed coal chemical dataset\nCoal show that LLM-DER performs outstandingly in domain-specific entity\nrecognition, not only outperforming the existing GPT-3.5-turbo baseline, but\nalso exceeding the fully-supervised baseline, verifying its effectiveness in\nentity recognition.\n","authors":["Le Xiao","Yunfei Xu","Jing Zhao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10077v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13292v2","updated":"2024-09-16T08:23:30Z","published":"2024-07-18T08:46:47Z","title":"Low-Resourced Speech Recognition for Iu Mien Language via\n  Weakly-Supervised Phoneme-based Multilingual Pre-training","summary":"  The mainstream automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology usually requires\nhundreds to thousands of hours of annotated speech data.

We\nhighlight a key misalignment between vision models and humans: whereas human\nconceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale\ndistinctions, model representations do not accurately capture all these levels\nof abstraction.

Some of the most widely used approaches that select\nas clean samples for which the model itself (the in-training model) has high\nconfidence, e.g., `small loss', can suffer from the so called\n`self-confirmation' bias. This bias arises because the in-training model, is at\nleast partially trained on the noisy labels. Furthermore, in the classification\ncase, an additional challenge arises because some of the label noise is between\nclasses that are visually very similar (`hard noise'). This paper addresses\nthese challenges by proposing a method (\\textit{CLIPCleaner}) that leverages\nCLIP, a powerful Vision-Language (VL) model for constructing a zero-shot\nclassifier for efficient, offline, clean sample selection. This has the\nadvantage that the sample selection is decoupled from the in-training model and\nthat the sample selection is aware of the semantic and visual similarities\nbetween the classes due to the way that CLIP is trained. We provide theoretical\njustifications and empirical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of CLIP for\nLNL compared to conventional pre-trained models. Compared to current methods\nthat combine iterative sample selection with various techniques,\n\\textit{CLIPCleaner} offers a simple, single-step approach that achieves\ncompetitive or superior performance on benchmark datasets. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first time a VL model has been used for sample selection\nto address the problem of Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL), highlighting their\npotential in the domain.\n","authors":["Chen Feng","Georgios Tzimiropoulos","Ioannis Patras"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10012v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted to ACMMM2024.

Token pruning is an effective solution for speeding up MLLMs, but\nwhen and how to drop tokens still remains a challenge. In this paper, we\npropose a novel and training-free approach for the effective visual token\npruning of MLLMs, termed FitPrune, which can quickly produce a complete pruning\nrecipe for MLLMs according to a pre-defined budget. Specifically, FitPrune\nconsiders token pruning as a statistical problem of MLLM and its objective is\nto find out an optimal pruning scheme that can minimize the divergence of the\nattention distributions before and after pruning. In practice, FitPrune can be\nquickly accomplished based on the attention statistics from a small batch of\ninference data, avoiding the expensive trials of MLLMs. According to the\npruning recipe, an MLLM can directly remove the redundant visual tokens of\ndifferent examples during inference. To validate FitPrune, we apply it to a set\nof recent MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-HR and LLaVA-NEXT, and conduct\nextensive experiments on a set of benchmarks. The experimental results show\nthat our FitPrune can not only reduce the computational complexity to a large\nextent, while retaining high performance, e.g., -54.9% FLOPs for LLaVA-NEXT\nwith only 0.5% accuracy drop.

These phenomena conflict\nwith conventional explainability methods based on the class attention map\n(CAM), where the raw model can highlight the local foreground regions using\nglobal supervision without alignment. To address these problems, we take a\ncloser look at its architecture and features. Based on thorough analyses, we\nfind the raw self-attentions link to inconsistent semantic regions, resulting\nin the opposite visualization. Besides, the noisy activations are owing to\nredundant features among categories. Building on these insights, we propose the\nCLIP Surgery for reliable CAM, a method that allows surgery-like modifications\nto the inference architecture and features, without further fine-tuning as\nclassical CAM methods. This approach significantly improves the explainability\nof CLIP, surpassing existing methods by large margins. Besides, it enables\nmultimodal visualization and extends the capacity of raw CLIP on\nopen-vocabulary tasks without extra alignment.

However, the limited available\nnavigation data can hinder optimal feature learning, impacting the system's\nperformance in complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose a shared\nencoder trained on multiple computer vision tasks critical for urban\nnavigation, such as depth, pose, and 3D scene flow estimation, as well as\nsemantic, instance, panoptic, and motion segmentation. By incorporating diverse\nvisual information used by humans during navigation, this unified encoder might\nenhance steering angle estimation.

Classifying historical documents based\non watermarks is challenging due to their diversity, noisy samples, multiple\nrepresentation modes, and minor distinctions between classes and intra-class\nvariations. This paper proposes a modified U-net-based conditional generative\nadversarial network (GAN) named Npix2Cpix to translate noisy raw historical\nwatermarked images into clean, handwriting-free watermarked images by\nperforming image translation from degraded (noisy) pixels to clean pixels.\nUsing image-to-image translation and adversarial learning, the network creates\nclutter-free images for watermark restoration and categorization. The generator\nand discriminator of the proposed GAN are trained using two separate loss\nfunctions, each based on the distance between images, to learn the mapping from\nthe input noisy image to the output clean image. After using the proposed GAN\nto pre-process noisy watermarked images, Siamese-based one-shot learning is\nemployed for watermark classification.

However, their\navailability is comparatively limited in contrast to normal field of view\n(NFoV) images, since specialized cameras are required to take omni-directional\nimages. Consequently, several methods have been proposed based on generative\nadversarial networks (GAN) to synthesize omni-directional images, but these\napproaches have shown difficulties in training of the models, due to\ninstability and/or significant time consumption in the training. To address\nthese problems, this paper proposes a novel omni-directional image synthesis\nmethod, 2S-ODIS (Two-Stage Omni-Directional Image Synthesis), which generated\nhigh-quality omni-directional images but drastically reduced the training time.\nThis was realized by utilizing the VQGAN (Vector Quantized GAN) model\npre-trained on a large-scale NFoV image database such as ImageNet without\nfine-tuning. Since this pre-trained model does not represent distortions of\nomni-directional images in the equi-rectangular projection (ERP), it cannot be\napplied directly to the omni-directional image synthesis in ERP. Therefore,\ntwo-stage structure was adopted to first create a global coarse image in ERP\nand then refine the image by integrating multiple local NFoV images in the\nhigher resolution to compensate the distortions in ERP, both of which are based\non the pre-trained VQGAN model. As a result, the proposed method, 2S-ODIS,\nachieved the reduction of the training time from 14 days in OmniDreamer to four\ndays in higher image quality.\n","authors":["Atsuya Nakata","Takao Yamanaka"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09969v1.pdf","comment":"ECCV2024 https://github.com/islab-sophia/2S-ODIS"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09968v1","updated":"2024-09-16T03:59:01Z","published":"2024-09-16T03:59:01Z","title":"Artificial Intelligence-Based Opportunistic Coronary Calcium Screening\n  in the Veterans Affairs National Healthcare System","summary":"  Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is highly predictive of cardiovascular events.\nWhile millions of chest CT scans are performed annually in the United States,\nCAC is not routinely quantified from scans done for non-cardiac purposes.

To address this misalignment, we first train a teacher model to\nimitate human judgments, then transfer human-like structure from its\nrepresentations into pretrained state-of-the-art vision foundation models.\nThese human-aligned models more accurately approximate human behavior and\nuncertainty across a wide range of similarity tasks, including a new dataset of\nhuman judgments spanning multiple levels of semantic abstractions. They also\nperform better on a diverse set of machine learning tasks, increasing\ngeneralization and out-of-distribution robustness. Thus, infusing neural\nnetworks with additional human knowledge yields a best-of-both-worlds\nrepresentation that is both more consistent with human cognition and more\npractically useful, thus paving the way toward more robust, interpretable, and\nhuman-like artificial intelligence systems.\n","authors":["Lukas Muttenthaler","Klaus Greff","Frieda Born","Bernhard Spitzer","Simon Kornblith","Michael C.

Another significant\nreason for choosing these algorithms is \\textit{avoid storing observations in\nmemory} as commonly done in batch incremental settings. However, the design of\ninstance incremental algorithms often assumes immediate availability of labels,\nwhich is an optimistic assumption. In many real-world scenarios, such as fraud\ndetection or credit scoring, labels may be delayed. Consequently, batch\nincremental algorithms are widely used in many real-world tasks. This raises an\nimportant question: \"In delayed settings, is instance incremental learning the\nbest option regarding predictive performance and computational efficiency?\"\nUnfortunately, this question has not been studied in depth, probably due to the\nscarcity of real datasets containing delayed information.

While existing\ncomputational models, especially those based on machine learning, aim to\npredict lightning-ignited wildfires, they are typically tailored to specific\nregions with unique characteristics, limiting their global applicability. In\nthis study, we present machine learning models designed to characterize and\npredict lightning-ignited wildfires on a global scale. Our approach involves\nclassifying lightning-ignited versus anthropogenic wildfires, and estimating\nwith high accuracy the probability of lightning to ignite a fire based on a\nwide spectrum of factors such as meteorological conditions and vegetation.\nUtilizing these models, we analyze seasonal and spatial trends in\nlightning-ignited wildfires shedding light on the impact of climate change on\nthis phenomenon.

In this paper, we explore the\nhypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different\nlayers, introducing the idea of ``Concept Depth'' to suggest that more complex\nconcepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize\nconcepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of\nincreasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We\nconduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across\nvarious LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) on various datasets spanning the\nthree domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently\nconduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks\ntypically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding.

However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of\nvarying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the\nhypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different\nlayers, introducing the idea of ``Concept Depth'' to suggest that more complex\nconcepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize\nconcepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of\nincreasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We\nconduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across\nvarious LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) on various datasets spanning the\nthree domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently\nconduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks\ntypically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally,\nwe examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and\nquantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our\nfindings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual\nunderstanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored.

Recent works revealed a general vulnerability of TSR models to\nphysical-world adversarial attacks, which can be low-cost, highly deployable,\nand capable of causing severe attack effects such as hiding a critical traffic\nsign or spoofing a fake one. However, so far existing works generally only\nconsidered evaluating the attack effects on academic TSR models, leaving the\nimpacts of such attacks on real-world commercial TSR systems largely unclear.\nIn this paper, we conduct the first large-scale measurement of physical-world\nadversarial attacks against commercial TSR systems. Our testing results reveal\nthat it is possible for existing attack works from academia to have highly\nreliable (100\\%) attack success against certain commercial TSR system\nfunctionality, but such attack capabilities are not generalizable, leading to\nmuch lower-than-expected attack success rates overall. We find that one\npotential major factor is a spatial memorization design that commonly exists in\ntoday's commercial TSR systems. We design new attack success metrics that can\nmathematically model the impacts of such design on the TSR system-level attack\nsuccess, and use them to revisit existing attacks.

This has led to a growing interest in analyzing and\nextracting insights from these meetings, which requires effective detection and\ntracking of unique individuals. In practice, there is no standardization in\nvideo meetings recording layout, and how they are captured across the different\nplatforms and services. This, in turn, creates a challenge in acquiring this\ndata stream and analyzing it in a uniform fashion. Our approach provides a\nsolution to the most general form of video recording, usually consisting of a\ngrid of participants (\\cref{fig:videomeeting}) from a single video source with\nno metadata on participant locations, while using the least amount of\nconstraints and assumptions as to how the data was acquired. Conventional\napproaches often use YOLO models coupled with tracking algorithms, assuming\nlinear motion trajectories akin to that observed in CCTV footage. However, such\nassumptions fall short in virtual meetings, where participant video feed window\ncan abruptly change location across the grid. In an organic video meeting\nsetting, participants frequently join and leave, leading to sudden, non-linear\nmovements on the video grid. This disrupts optical flow-based tracking methods\nthat depend on linear motion. Consequently, standard object detection and\ntracking methods might mistakenly assign multiple participants to the same\ntracker. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to track and re-identify\nparticipants in remote video meetings, by utilizing the spatio-temporal priors\narising from the data in our domain.

In contrast, we propose\nText Guided LLaVA (TG-LLaVA) in this paper, which optimizes VLMs by guiding the\nvision encoder with text, offering a new and orthogonal optimization direction.\nSpecifically, inspired by the purpose-driven logic inherent in human behavior,\nwe use learnable latent embeddings as a bridge to analyze textual instruction\nand add the analysis results to the vision encoder as guidance, refining it.\nSubsequently, another set of latent embeddings extracts additional detailed\ntext-guided information from high-resolution local patches as auxiliary\ninformation. Finally, with the guidance of text, the vision encoder can extract\ntext-related features, similar to how humans focus on the most relevant parts\nof an image when considering a question. This results in generating better\nanswers. Experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.

In this paper, we study gender wage decompositions, which\nrequire estimating the portion of the gender wage gap explained by career\nhistories of workers. Classical methods for decomposing the wage gap employ\nsimple predictive models of wages which condition on a small set of simple\nsummaries of labor history. The problem is that these predictive models cannot\ntake advantage of the full complexity of a worker's history, and the resulting\ndecompositions thus suffer from omitted variable bias (OVB), where covariates\nthat are correlated with both gender and wages are not included in the model.\nHere we explore an alternative methodology for wage gap decomposition that\nemploys powerful foundation models, such as large language models, as the\npredictive engine. Foundation models excel at making accurate predictions from\ncomplex, high-dimensional inputs. We use a custom-built foundation model,\ndesigned to predict wages from full labor histories, to decompose the gender\nwage gap. We prove that the way such models are usually trained might still\nlead to OVB, but develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this\nissue. Our model captures a richer representation of career history than simple\nmodels and predicts wages more accurately. In detail, we first provide a novel\nset of conditions under which an estimator of the wage gap based on a\nfine-tuned foundation model is $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent. Building on the theory,\nwe then propose methods for fine-tuning foundation models that minimize OVB.\nUsing data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that history\nexplains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can\nmeasure, and we identify elements of history that are important for reducing\nOVB.\n","authors":["Keyon Vafa","Susan Athey","David M.

To achieve dependable off-policy predictions,\nrecent work on Conformal Off-Policy Prediction (COPP) leverage the conformal\nprediction framework to derive prediction regions with probabilistic guarantees\nunder the target process. Existing COPP methods can account for the\ndistribution shifts induced by policy switching, but are limited to\nsingle-agent systems and scalar outcomes (e.g., rewards).

A key contribution of MA-COPP is to avoid enumeration or\nexhaustive search of the output space of agent trajectories, which is instead\nrequired by existing COPP methods to construct the prediction region.

To address these challenges, we introduce a\nnovel skeleton-based training framework (C$^2$VL) based on Cross-modal\nContrastive learning that uses the progressive distillation to learn\ntask-agnostic human skeleton action representation from the Vision-Language\nknowledge prompts. Specifically, we establish the vision-language action\nconcept space through vision-language knowledge prompts generated by\npre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs), which enrich the fine-grained\ndetails that the skeleton action space lacks. Moreover, we propose the\nintra-modal self-similarity and inter-modal cross-consistency softened targets\nin the cross-modal representation learning process to progressively control and\nguide the degree of pulling vision-language knowledge prompts and corresponding\nskeletons closer.

To\naddress this, we present the Multimodal-based Author Bangla Intent\nClassification (MABIC) framework, utilizing text and images to gain deeper\ninsights into the conveyed intentions. We have created a dataset named\n\"Uddessho,\" comprising 3,048 instances sourced from social media. Our\nmethodology comprises two approaches for classifying textual intent and\nmultimodal author intent, incorporating early fusion and late fusion\ntechniques. In our experiments, the unimodal approach achieved an accuracy of\n64.53% in interpreting Bangla textual intent. In contrast, our multimodal\napproach significantly outperformed traditional unimodal methods, achieving an\naccuracy of 76.19%. This represents an improvement of 11.66%. To our best\nknowledge, this is the first research work on multimodal-based author intent\nclassification for low-resource Bangla language social media posts.\n","authors":["Fatema Tuj Johora Faria","Mukaffi Bin Moin","Md.

Previous work pointed out that max-min fairness (MMF) is a\nbetter metric to support weak providers. However, when considering MMF, the\nfeatures or parameters of these roles vary over time, how to ensure long-term\nprovider MMF has become a significant challenge. We observed that\nrecommendation feedback loops (named RFL) will greatly influence the provider\nMMF in the long term. RFL means that recommender systems can only receive\nfeedback on exposed items from users and update recommender models\nincrementally based on this feedback. When utilizing the feedback, the\nrecommender model will regard the unexposed items as negative. In this way, the\ntail provider will not get the opportunity to be exposed, and its items will\nalways be considered negative samples. Such phenomena will become more and more\nserious in RFL. To alleviate the problem, this paper proposes an online ranking\nmodel named Long-Term Provider Max-min Fairness (named LTP-MMF). Theoretical\nanalysis shows that the long-term regret of LTP-MMF enjoys a sub-linear bound.\nExperimental results on three public recommendation benchmarks demonstrated\nthat LTP-MMF can outperform the baselines in the long term.\n","authors":["Chen Xu","Xiaopeng Ye","Jun Xu","Xiao Zhang","Weiran Shen","Ji-Rong Wen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05902v2.pdf","comment":"accepted in TOIS 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09253v1","updated":"2024-09-14T01:45:04Z","published":"2024-09-14T01:45:04Z","title":"Unleash LLMs Potential for Recommendation by Coordinating Twin-Tower\n  Dynamic Semantic Token Generator","summary":"  Owing to the unprecedented capability in semantic understanding and logical\nreasoning, the pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have shown fantastic\npotential in developing the next-generation recommender systems (RSs).

Recent advancements in\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to substantial progress in\nthis area, but their demands for extensive model parameters, computing power,\nand high latency makes them impractical for scenarios requiring lightweight,\non-device solutions with low latency or heightened privacy. Additionally, the\nlack of high-quality datasets has hindered the development of such lightweight\nmodels. To address these challenges, we propose UI-JEPA, a novel framework that\nemploys masking strategies to learn abstract UI embeddings from unlabeled data\nthrough self-supervised learning, combined with an LLM decoder fine-tuned for\nuser intent prediction. We also introduce two new UI-grounded multimodal\ndatasets, \"Intent in the Wild\" (IIW) and \"Intent in the Tame\" (IIT), designed\nfor few-shot and zero-shot UI understanding tasks. IIW consists of 1.7K videos\nacross 219 intent categories, while IIT contains 914 videos across 10\ncategories. We establish the first baselines for these datasets, showing that\nrepresentations learned using a JEPA-style objective, combined with an LLM\ndecoder, can achieve user intent predictions that match the performance of\nstate-of-the-art large MLLMs, but with significantly reduced annotation and\ndeployment resources.

This is\nespecially true for tasks where rule-based approaches fall short, like type\nprediction. The type prediction task consists in adding a new type annotation\nto a partially typed program, such that the resulting program is closer to\nbeing fully typed. The intractability of rule-based approaches and high cost of\nmanual annotation make CodeLLMs an attractive solution to the problem. However,\nCodeLLMs are still far from being deployed on the large-scale due to doubts\nsurrounding their reliability.\n  To shed some light on how CodeLLMs approach type prediction, we investigate\nwhat happens when a model mispredicts a type. We show that by applying\nsemantics-preserving edits to code, CodeLLMs are eventually misled into\nmispredicting type annotations. However, by leveraging activation steering we\nare able to \"steer\" the model back to the correct prediction, making models\nmore robust against semantically irrelevant prompt features.

This integration of the language enables\nmore advanced human-machine interaction. The essence of interaction is\ncognitive alignment, which typically requires multiple information exchanges,\nespecially in the sequential decision-making process of VLT. However, current\nVLT benchmarks do not account for multi-round interactions during tracking.\nThey provide only an initial text and bounding box (bbox) in the first frame,\nwith no further interaction as tracking progresses, deviating from the original\nmotivation of the VLT task. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nand robust benchmark, VLT-MI (Visual Language Tracking with Multi-modal\nInteraction), which introduces multi-round interaction into the VLT task for\nthe first time. (1) We generate diverse, multi-granularity texts for\nmulti-round, multi-modal interaction based on existing mainstream VLT\nbenchmarks using DTLLM-VLT, leveraging the world knowledge of LLMs. (2) We\npropose a new VLT interaction paradigm that achieves multi-round interaction\nthrough text updates and object recovery. When multiple tracking failures\noccur, we provide the tracker with more aligned texts and corrected bboxes\nthrough interaction, thereby expanding the scope of VLT downstream tasks.

To handle this word order gap, interpreters maintain the word\norder of the source language as much as possible to keep up with original\nlanguage to minimize its latency while maintaining its quality, whereas in\ntranslation reordering happens to keep fluency in the target language.

In addition, the Recommender Systems community tends\nto favour traditional end-to-end neural network learning over these models. Our\nresearch addresses this gap and evaluates the applicability of six pretrained\nbackend models (MusicFM, Music2Vec, MERT, EncodecMAE, Jukebox, and MusiCNN) in\nthe context of MRS. We assess their performance using three recommendation\nmodels: K-nearest neighbours (KNN), shallow neural network, and BERT4Rec. Our\nfindings suggest that pretrained audio representations exhibit significant\nperformance variability between traditional MIR tasks and MRS, indicating that\nvaluable aspects of musical information captured by backend models may differ\ndepending on the task.

Many real-world networks\nare directed and temporal, where edges have timestamps. Motif counting in\ndirected, temporal graphs is especially challenging because there are a\nplethora of different kinds of patterns. Temporal motif counts reveal much\nricher information and there is a need for scalable algorithms for motif\ncounting.\n  A major challenge in counting is that there can be trillions of temporal\nmotif matches even with a graph with only millions of vertices. Both the motifs\nand the input graphs can have multiple edges between two vertices, leading to a\ncombinatorial explosion problem. Counting temporal motifs involving just four\nvertices is not feasible with current state-of-the-art algorithms.\n  We design an algorithm, TEACUPS, that addresses this problem using a novel\ntechnique of temporal path sampling. We combine a path sampling method with\ncarefully designed temporal data structures, to propose an efficient\napproximate algorithm for temporal motif counting. TEACUPS is an unbiased\nestimator with provable concentration behavior, which can be used to bound the\nestimation error. For a Bitcoin graph with hundreds of millions of edges,\nTEACUPS runs in less than 1 minute, while the exact counting algorithm takes\nmore than a day.

Recent works have considered steering target users beyond\ntheir historical interests by directly adjusting items exposed to them.\nHowever, the recommended items for direct steering might not align perfectly\nwith users' interests evolution, detrimentally affecting target users'\nexperience. To avoid this issue, we propose a new task named Proactive\nRecommendation in Social Networks (PRSN) that indirectly steers users' interest\nby utilizing the influence of social neighbors, i.e., indirect steering by\nadjusting the exposure of a target item to target users' neighbors. The key to\nPRSN lies in answering an interventional question: what would a target user's\nfeedback be on a target item if the item is exposed to the user's different\nneighbors? To answer this question, we resort to causal inference and formalize\nPRSN as: (1) estimating the potential feedback of a user on an item, under the\nnetwork interference by the item's exposure to the user's neighbors; and (2)\nadjusting the exposure of a target item to target users' neighbors to trade off\nsteering performance and the damage to the neighbors' experience. To this end,\nwe propose a Neighbor Interference Recommendation (NIRec) framework with two\nkey modules: (1)an interference representation-based estimation module for\nmodeling potential feedback; and (2) a post-learning-based optimization module\nfor optimizing a target item's exposure to trade off steering performance and\nthe neighbors' experience by greedy search.

Specifically, we\ndevelop dual-path rhythm-genre inversion to effectively integrate the rhythm\nand genre of a dance motion sequence into the textual space of a text-to-music\nmodel. Contrary to traditional textual inversion methods, which directly update\ntext embeddings to reconstruct a single target object, our approach utilizes\nseparate rhythm and genre encoders to obtain text embeddings for two\npseudo-words, adapting to the varying rhythms and genres. We collect a new\ndataset called In-the-wild Dance Videos (InDV) and demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation\nmetrics. Furthermore, our method is able to adapt to changes in tempo and\neffectively integrates with the inherent text-guided generation capability of\nthe pre-trained model.

In this paper, we explore the challenges of measuring and\nreporting popularity bias. We showcase the impact of data properties and\nalgorithm configurations on popularity bias by combining synthetic data with\nwell known recommender systems frameworks that implement UserKNN.

Second, we locate UserKNN configurations that\nvary across implementations in literature. We evaluate popularity bias for five\nsynthetic datasets and five UserKNN configurations, and offer insights on their\njoint effect. We find that, depending on the data characteristics, various\nUserKNN configurations can lead to different conclusions regarding the\npropagation of popularity bias.

In\nFedRecs, users keep their data locally and only contribute their local\ncollaborative information by uploading model parameters to a central server.\nWhile this rigid framework protects users' raw data during training, it\nseverely compromises the recommendation model's performance due to the\nfollowing reasons: (1) Due to the power law distribution nature of user\nbehavior data, individual users have few data points to train a recommendation\nmodel, resulting in uploaded model updates that may be far from optimal; (2) As\neach user's uploaded parameters are learned from local data, which lacks global\ncollaborative information, relying solely on parameter aggregation methods such\nas FedAvg to fuse global collaborative information may be suboptimal.

The\nfurther pursuit of enhancing the editability of images has sparked significant\ninterest in the downstream task of inpainting a novel object described by a\ntext prompt within a designated region in the image. Nevertheless, the problem\nis not trivial from two aspects: 1) Solely relying on one single U-Net to align\ntext prompt and visual object across all the denoising timesteps is\ninsufficient to generate desired objects; 2) The controllability of object\ngeneration is not guaranteed in the intricate sampling space of diffusion\nmodel. In this paper, we propose to decompose the typical single-stage object\ninpainting into two cascaded processes: 1) semantic pre-inpainting that infers\nthe semantic features of desired objects in a multi-modal feature space; 2)\nhigh-fieldity object generation in diffusion latent space that pivots on such\ninpainted semantic features. To achieve this, we cascade a Transformer-based\nsemantic inpainter and an object inpainting diffusion model, leading to a novel\nCAscaded Transformer-Diffusion (CAT-Diffusion) framework for text-guided object\ninpainting. Technically, the semantic inpainter is trained to predict the\nsemantic features of the target object conditioning on unmasked context and\ntext prompt.

Nevertheless, it is not trivial to directly\napply diffusion models for synthesizing an image of a target person wearing a\ngiven in-shop garment, i.e., image-based virtual try-on (VTON) task. The\ndifficulty originates from the aspect that the diffusion process should not\nonly produce holistically high-fidelity photorealistic image of the target\nperson, but also locally preserve every appearance and texture detail of the\ngiven garment. To address this, we shape a new Diffusion model, namely GarDiff,\nwhich triggers the garment-focused diffusion process with amplified guidance of\nboth basic visual appearance and detailed textures (i.e., high-frequency\ndetails) derived from the given garment. GarDiff first remoulds a pre-trained\nlatent diffusion model with additional appearance priors derived from the CLIP\nand VAE encodings of the reference garment.

While extant research has endeavored to extend\nthe application of 3DGS from static to dynamic scenes, such efforts have been\nconsistently impeded by excessive model sizes, constraints on video duration,\nand content deviation. These limitations significantly compromise the\nstreamability of dynamic 3D Gaussian models, thereby restricting their utility\nin downstream applications, including volumetric video, autonomous vehicle, and\nimmersive technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality.\n  This paper introduces SwinGS, a novel framework for training, delivering, and\nrendering volumetric video in a real-time streaming fashion. To address the\naforementioned challenges and enhance streamability, SwinGS integrates\nspacetime Gaussian with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to adapt the model to\nfit various 3D scenes across frames, in the meantime employing a sliding window\ncaptures Gaussian snapshots for each frame in an accumulative way. We implement\na prototype of SwinGS and demonstrate its streamability across various datasets\nand scenes.

Exploring diffusion models\nto enhance the generated images nevertheless is not trivial and necessitates to\ndelicately enrich plentiful details while preserving the visual appearance of\nkey content in the original image. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,\nnamely FreeEnhance, for content-consistent image enhancement using the\noff-the-shelf image diffusion models.

In the noising stage, FreeEnhance is\ndevised to add lighter noise to the region with higher frequency to preserve\nthe high-frequent patterns (e.g., edge, corner) in the original image. In the\ndenoising stage, we present three target properties as constraints to\nregularize the predicted noise, enhancing images with high acutance and high\nvisual quality.

This task enables pre-trained models to\ngenerate novel images based on unique subjects. Existing studies adopt a\nself-reconstructive perspective, focusing on capturing all details of a single\nimage, which will misconstrue the specific image's irrelevant attributes (e.g.,\nview, pose, and background) as the subject intrinsic attributes. This\nmisconstruction leads to both overfitting or underfitting of irrelevant and\nintrinsic attributes of the subject, i.e., these attributes are\nover-represented or under-represented simultaneously, causing a trade-off\nbetween similarity and controllability. In this study, we argue an ideal\nsubject representation can be achieved by a cross-differential perspective,\ni.e., decoupling subject intrinsic attributes from irrelevant attributes via\ncontrastive learning, which allows the model to focus more on intrinsic\nattributes through intra-consistency (features of the same subject are\nspatially closer) and inter-distinctiveness (features of different subjects\nhave distinguished differences). Specifically, we propose CustomContrast, a\nnovel framework, which includes a Multilevel Contrastive Learning (MCL)\nparadigm and a Multimodal Feature Injection (MFI) Encoder. The MCL paradigm is\nused to extract intrinsic features of subjects from high-level semantics to\nlow-level appearance through crossmodal semantic contrastive learning and\nmultiscale appearance contrastive learning.

Collaborative\nfiltering-based deep learning techniques have regained popularity due to their\nstraightforward nature, relying only on user-item interactions.

Initially, researchers focused on\nenhancing performance by developing complex interaction modules. However, there\nhas been a recent shift toward refining loss functions and negative sampling\nstrategies. This shift has led to an increased interest in contrastive\nlearning, which pulls similar pairs closer while pushing dissimilar ones apart.\nContrastive learning may bring challenges like high memory demands and\nunder-utilization of some negative samples.

However, these methods face challenges, including lack\nof supervision, inability to optimize reflection sources, inflexibility to\ndiverse user needs, and high computational costs.

That is, given the learning\nhistory and learning target of a student, a question recommender is supposed to\nselect the question that will bring the most improvement for students. Previous\nmethods typically model the question recommendation as a sequential\ndecision-making problem, estimating students' learning state with the learning\nhistory, and feeding the learning state with the learning target to a neural\nnetwork to select the recommended question from a question set. However,\nprevious methods are faced with two challenges: (1) learning history is\nunavailable in the cold start scenario, which makes the recommender generate\ninappropriate recommendations; (2) the size of the question set is much large,\nwhich makes it difficult for the recommender to select the best question\nprecisely. To address the challenges, we propose a method called hierarchical\nlarge language model for question recommendation (HierLLM), which is a\nLLM-based hierarchical structure. The LLM-based structure enables HierLLM to\ntackle the cold start issue with the strong reasoning abilities of LLM. The\nhierarchical structure takes advantage of the fact that the number of concepts\nis significantly smaller than the number of questions, narrowing the range of\nselectable questions by first identifying the relevant concept for the\nto-recommend question, and then selecting the recommended question based on\nthat concept.

Recent explorations have\nutilized LVLMs to tackle zero-shot visual anomaly detection (VAD) challenges by\npairing images with textual descriptions indicative of normal and abnormal\nconditions, referred to as anomaly prompts. However, existing approaches depend\non static anomaly prompts that are prone to cross-semantic ambiguity, and\nprioritize global image-level representations over crucial local pixel-level\nimage-to-text alignment that is necessary for accurate anomaly localization.

This approach facilitates very low-resolution face recognition by\njointly distilling generative and discriminative models via two distillation\nmodules. Firstly, the generative representation distillation takes the encoder\nof a diffusion model pretrained for face super-resolution as the generative\nteacher to supervise the learning of the student backbone via feature\nregression, and then freezes the student backbone.

In this\nway, the general backbone representation can be transformed into discriminative\nhead representation, leading to a robust and discriminative student model for\nvery low-resolution face recognition.

Over a 3.5-month testing period, PhishLang successfully\nidentified 25,796 phishing URLs, many of which were undetected by popular\nantiphishing blocklists, thus demonstrating its potential to enhance current\ndetection measures. Capitalizing on PhishLang's resource efficiency, we release\nthe first open-source fully client-side Chromium browser extension that\nprovides inference locally without requiring to consult an online blocklist and\ncan be run on low-end systems with no impact on inference times. Our\nimplementation not only outperforms prevalent (server-side) phishing tools, but\nis significantly more effective than the limited commercial client-side\nmeasures available. Furthermore, we study how PhishLang can be integrated with\nGPT-3.5 Turbo to create explainable blocklisting -- which, upon detection of a\nwebsite, provides users with detailed contextual information about the features\nthat led to a website being marked as phishing.\n","authors":["Sayak Saha Roy","Shirin Nilizadeh"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05667v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05806v1","updated":"2024-09-09T17:11:51Z","published":"2024-09-09T17:11:51Z","title":"Benchmarking Chinese Knowledge Rectification in Large Language Models","summary":"  While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative\ncapabilities, they are not without flaws, particularly in the form of\nhallucinations.

Our approach introduces a learnable distortion\nmatrix, denoted as P, which is employed for linearly transforming gradients.\nThis transformation slightly adjusts gradients during each iteration, enabling\nthe optimizer to better adapt to distinct dataset characteristics. By learning\nan appropriate distortion matrix P, our method aims to adaptively adjust\ngradient information across different data distributions, thereby enhancing\noptimization performance. Our research showcases the potential of this novel\napproach through theoretical insights and empirical evaluations. Experimental\nresults across various tasks and datasets validate the superiority of our\noptimizer that integrates the 'warped gradient descend' concept in terms of\nadaptability. Furthermore, we explore effective strategies for training the\nadaptation matrix P and identify scenarios where this method can yield optimal\nresults. In summary, this study introduces an innovative approach that merges\nthe 'warped gradient descend' concept from Meta Learning with the Adam\noptimizer.

In this study, we propose \\textbf{PoseTalk}, a\nTHG system that can freely generate lip-synchronized talking head videos with\nfree head poses conditioned on text prompts and audio. The core insight of our\nmethod is using head pose to connect visual, linguistic, and audio signals.\nFirst, we propose to generate poses from both audio and text prompts, where the\naudio offers short-term variations and rhythm correspondence of the head\nmovements and the text prompts describe the long-term semantics of head\nmotions. To achieve this goal, we devise a Pose Latent Diffusion (PLD) model to\ngenerate motion latent from text prompts and audio cues in a pose latent space.\nSecond, we observe a loss-imbalance problem: the loss for the lip region\ncontributes less than 4\\% of the total reconstruction loss caused by both pose\nand lip, making optimization lean towards head movements rather than lip\nshapes. To address this issue, we propose a refinement-based learning strategy\nto synthesize natural talking videos using two cascaded networks, i.e.,\nCoarseNet, and RefineNet. The CoarseNet estimates coarse motions to produce\nanimated images in novel poses and the RefineNet focuses on learning finer lip\nmotions by progressively estimating lip motions from low-to-high resolutions,\nyielding improved lip-synchronization performance.

While significantly improving the\nperformance of the mobile applications, the cloud-based mechanism often causes\nprivacy concerns as the multimedia data and services are offloaded from the\ntrusted user device to untrusted cloud servers. Several recent studies have\nproposed perturbation-based privacy preserving mechanisms, which obfuscate the\noffloaded multimedia data to eliminate privacy exposures without affecting the\nfunctionality of the remote multimedia services.

To address this\nissue, we propose a novel method called \\textit{Diversity-Promoting\nCollaborative Metric Learning} (DPCML), with the hope of considering the\ncommonly ignored minority interest of the user. The key idea behind DPCML is to\nintroduce a set of multiple representations for each user in the system where\nusers' preference toward an item is aggregated by taking the minimum item-user\ndistance among their embedding set. Specifically, we instantiate two effective\nassignment strategies to explore a proper quantity of vectors for each user.\nMeanwhile, a \\textit{Diversity Control Regularization Scheme} (DCRS) is\ndeveloped to accommodate the multi-vector representation strategy better.\nTheoretically, we show that DPCML could induce a smaller generalization error\nthan traditional CML.

GFVC frameworks\nachieve an extreme gain in coding efficiency with over 70% bitrate savings when\ncompared to conventional codecs at bitrates below 10kbps. In recent MPEG/JVET\nstandardization efforts, all the information required to reconstruct video\nsequences using GFVC frameworks are adopted as part of the supplemental\nenhancement information (SEI) in existing compression pipelines. In light of\nthis development, we aim to address a challenge that has been weakly addressed\nin prior GFVC frameworks, i.e., reconstruction drift as the distance between\nthe reference and target frames increases. This challenge creates the need to\nupdate the reference buffer more frequently by transmitting more Intra-refresh\nframes, which are the most expensive element of the GFVC bitstream. To overcome\nthis problem, we propose instead multiple reference animation as a robust\napproach to minimizing reconstruction drift, especially when used in a\nbi-directional prediction mode. Further, we propose a contrastive learning\nformulation for multi-reference animation. We observe that using a contrastive\nlearning framework enhances the representation capabilities of the animation\ngenerator. The resulting framework, MRDAC (Multi-Reference Deep Animation\nCodec) can therefore be used to compress longer sequences with fewer reference\nframes or achieve a significant gain in reconstruction accuracy at comparable\nbitrates to previous frameworks.

Concretely, traffic related to the\nadvertisement is considerably sparser compared to that of natural content,\nwhich motivates the development of transferring knowledge from the richer\nsource natural content domain to the sparser advertising domain. The challenges\ninclude the inefficiencies arising from the management of extensive source data\nand the problem of 'catastrophic forgetting' that results from the CTR model's\ndaily updating. To this end, we propose a novel tri-level asynchronous\nframework, i.e., Efficient Transfer Learning Framework for Cross-Domain\nClick-Through Rate Prediction (E-CDCTR), to transfer comprehensive knowledge of\nnatural content to advertisement CTR models. This framework consists of three\nkey components: Tiny Pre-training Model ((TPM), which trains a tiny CTR model\nwith several basic features on long-term natural data; Complete Pre-training\nModel (CPM), which trains a CTR model holding network structure and input\nfeatures the same as target advertisement on short-term natural data;\nAdvertisement CTR model (A-CTR), which derives its parameter initialization\nfrom CPM together with multiple historical embeddings from TPM as extra feature\nand then fine-tunes on advertisement data. TPM provides richer representations\nof user and item for both the CPM and A-CTR, effectively alleviating the\nforgetting problem inherent in the daily updates. CPM further enhances the\nadvertisement model by providing knowledgeable initialization, thereby\nalleviating the data sparsity challenges typically encountered by advertising\nCTR models.

Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) for dialog summarization have the potential to improve the\nexperience of meetings by reducing individuals' meeting load and increasing the\nclarity and alignment of meeting outputs.

Spiking\nneural networks (SNNs), which mimic the brain's information-processing\nmechanisms, are well-suited for emulating the human capability of AVSR. Despite\ntheir potential, research on SNNs for AVSR is scarce, with most existing\naudio-visual multimodal methods focused on object or digit recognition. These\nmodels simply integrate features from both modalities, neglecting their unique\ncharacteristics and interactions.

Inspired by human speech perception, this paper\nproposes a novel human-inspired SNN named HI-AVSNN for AVSR, incorporating\nthree key characteristics: cueing interaction, causal processing and spike\nactivity. For cueing interaction, we propose a visual-cued auditory attention\nmodule (VCA2M) that leverages visual cues to guide attention to auditory\nfeatures. We achieve causal processing by aligning the SNN's temporal dimension\nwith that of visual and auditory features and applying temporal masking to\nutilize only past and current information.

More specifically, we design\nPPVF with three core components: (1) \\textit{Online privacy budget scheduler},\nwhich employs a theoretically guaranteed online algorithm to select\nnon-requested videos as candidates with assigned privacy budgets. Alternative\nvideos are chosen by an online algorithm that is theoretically guaranteed to\nconsider both video utilities and available privacy budgets.

This dual approach bridges the semantic gap\nbetween visual and textual data, thereby improving the model's ability to\nprocess and interpret information from multiple images effectively.\nAdditionally, we design a dynamic reduction mechanism by for long-sequence\ncontinuous features to enhance multi-image processing efficiency. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that MaVEn significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding in\ncomplex multi-image scenarios, while also improving performance in single-image\ncontexts.\n","authors":["Chaoya Jiang","Jia Hongrui","Haiyang Xu","Wei Ye","Mengfan Dong","Ming Yan","Ji Zhang","Fei Huang","Shikun Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12321v2.pdf","comment":null}]},"2024-08-25T00:00:00Z":{"Multimedia":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13786v1","updated":"2024-08-25T09:29:20Z","published":"2024-08-25T09:29:20Z","title":"Localization of Synthetic Manipulations in Western Blot Images","summary":"  Recent breakthroughs in deep learning and generative systems have\nsignificantly fostered the creation of synthetic media, as well as the local\nalteration of real content via the insertion of highly realistic synthetic\nmanipulations.

These advanced models, despite their\nimpressive capabilities, are often trained on massive Internet datasets, making\nthem susceptible to generating content that perpetuates social stereotypes and\nbiases, which can lead to severe consequences. Prior research on assessing bias\nwithin image generation models suffers from several shortcomings, including\nlimited accuracy, reliance on extensive human labor, and lack of comprehensive\nanalysis. In this paper, we propose BiasPainter, a novel evaluation framework\nthat can accurately, automatically and comprehensively trigger social bias in\nimage generation models. BiasPainter uses a diverse range of seed images of\nindividuals and prompts the image generation models to edit these images using\ngender, race, and age-neutral queries. These queries span 62 professions, 39\nactivities, 57 types of objects, and 70 personality traits. The framework then\ncompares the edited images to the original seed images, focusing on the\nsignificant changes related to gender, race, and age. BiasPainter adopts a key\ninsight that these characteristics should not be modified when subjected to\nneutral prompts. Built upon this design, BiasPainter can trigger the social\nbias and evaluate the fairness of image generation models. We use BiasPainter\nto evaluate six widely-used image generation models, such as stable diffusion\nand Midjourney. Experimental results show that BiasPainter can successfully\ntrigger social bias in image generation models.

These paragraph queries are\ntightly correlated to each other and contain a wealth of abstract expressions\nsummarizing video storylines and specific descriptions portraying event\ndetails, which enables the model to learn multimodal perception on more\nintricate concepts over longer context dependencies. Based on the dataset, we\nfurther introduce a more complex setting of video grounding dubbed\nMulti-Paragraph Video Grounding (MPVG), which takes as input multiple\nparagraphs and a long video for grounding each paragraph query to its temporal\ninterval. In addition, we propose a novel Local-Global Multimodal Reasoner\n(LGMR) to explicitly model the local-global structures of long-term multimodal\ninputs for MPVG. Our method provides an effective baseline solution to the\nmulti-paragraph video grounding problem. Extensive experiments verify the\nproposed model's effectiveness as well as its superiority in long-term\nmulti-paragraph video grounding over prior state-of-the-arts. Dataset and code\nare publicly available.

The framework is designed to enhance the effectiveness of modality\nfusion and includes two auxiliary tasks: audio-video emotion alignment (AVEL)\nand cross-modal emotion label matching (MEM). First, AVEL achieves alignment of\nemotional information in audio-video representations through contrastive\nlearning. Then, a modal fusion network integrates the aligned features.\nMeanwhile, MEM assesses whether the emotions of the current sample pair are the\nsame, providing assistance for modal information fusion and guiding the model\nto focus more on emotional information. The experimental results conducted on\nIEMOCAP corpus show that Foal-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and\nemotion alignment is necessary before modal fusion.\n","authors":["Qifei Li","Yingming Gao","Yuhua Wen","Cong Wang","Ya Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09438v1.pdf","comment":"The paper has been accepted by INTERSPEECH 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09384v1","updated":"2024-08-18T07:03:53Z","published":"2024-08-18T07:03:53Z","title":"FD2Talk: Towards Generalized Talking Head Generation with Facial\n  Decoupled Diffusion Model","summary":"  Talking head generation is a significant research topic that still faces\nnumerous challenges. Previous works often adopt generative adversarial networks\nor regression models, which are plagued by generation quality and average\nfacial shape problem. Although diffusion models show impressive generative\nability, their exploration in talking head generation remains unsatisfactory.\nThis is because they either solely use the diffusion model to obtain an\nintermediate representation and then employ another pre-trained renderer, or\nthey overlook the feature decoupling of complex facial details, such as\nexpressions, head poses and appearance textures. Therefore, we propose a Facial\nDecoupled Diffusion model for Talking head generation called FD2Talk, which\nfully leverages the advantages of diffusion models and decouples the complex\nfacial details through multi-stages. Specifically, we separate facial details\ninto motion and appearance. In the initial phase, we design the Diffusion\nTransformer to accurately predict motion coefficients from raw audio. These\nmotions are highly decoupled from appearance, making them easier for the\nnetwork to learn compared to high-dimensional RGB images. Subsequently, in the\nsecond phase, we encode the reference image to capture appearance textures. The\npredicted facial and head motions and encoded appearance then serve as the\nconditions for the Diffusion UNet, guiding the frame generation. Benefiting\nfrom decoupling facial details and fully leveraging diffusion models, extensive\nexperiments substantiate that our approach excels in enhancing image quality\nand generating more accurate and diverse results compared to previous\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","authors":["Ziyu Yao","Xuxin Cheng","Zhiqi Huang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09384v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06707v4","updated":"2024-08-18T02:06:30Z","published":"2021-10-13T13:30:54Z","title":"Singer separation for karaoke content generation","summary":"  Due to the rapid development of deep learning, we can now successfully\nseparate singing voice from mono audio music. However, this separation can only\nextract human voices from other musical instruments, which is undesirable for\nkaraoke content generation applications that only require the separation of\nlead singers. For this karaoke application, we need to separate the music\ncontaining male and female duets into two vocals, or extract a single lead\nvocal from the music containing vocal harmony. For this reason, we propose in\nthis article to use a singer separation system, which generates karaoke content\nfor one or two separated lead singers. In particular, we introduced three\nmodels for the singer separation task and designed an automatic model selection\nscheme to distinguish how many lead singers are in the song. We also collected\na large enough data set, MIR-SingerSeparation, which has been publicly released\nto advance the frontier of this research. Our singer separation is most\nsuitable for sentimental ballads and can be directly applied to karaoke content\ngeneration. As far as we know, this is the first singer-separation work for\nreal-world karaoke applications.\n","authors":["Hsuan-Yu Lin","Xuanjun Chen","Jyh-Shing Roger Jang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06707v4.pdf","comment":null}]}}
